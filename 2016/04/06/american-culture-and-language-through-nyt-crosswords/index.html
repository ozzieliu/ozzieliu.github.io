<p>Project 4 at Metis is focused around unsupervised machine learning and
Natural Language Processing. But we also incorporate MongoDB for data storage,
Flask as a Python based web framework, and visualization with D3.</p>

<p>I love crossword puzzles and have been doing them for many years. Can I combine
crossword puzzles with data science?!</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>So of course, I researched and Googled to see if anything similar has been done, and I came
across a timely op-ed piece in the New York Times. Professor Charles Kruzman from UNC
wrote a very interesting article looking at how the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/07/opinion/what-74-years-of-times-crosswords-say-about-the-words-we-use.html">NYT Crossword puzzles say about the words we use</a>.
That’s it! I can extend on his project by using data science and unsupervised
machine learning. While Kruzman’s research focused on the foreign language usage,
I want to perform topic modeling on clues and answers, without manual input.</p>

<p>I was able to obtain about 40 years of NYT crossword puzzles with further research
on the web. So I parsed the raw data from JSON and stored it locally with MongoDB.
That’s 14,000+ puzzles with 1.2 million clue-answer pairs.</p>

<p><a name="goal"></a></p>

<h1 id="goal">Goal</h1>

<p>We know that crossword puzzles are <strong>creative and clever</strong>, but most importantly
they are <strong>current</strong>. Constructors and editors are well aware of what their
solvers know. In other words, crossword puzzles reflect culture and current
events. And by looking at them over time, we can see how American society has
shifted and how the English language has evolved.</p>

<p>My goal is straightforward: Given a word or phrase used as an answer in past
crossword puzzles, I want to visualize how its usage and meaning has changed over
time. And in doing so, get an unique view into how American culture and language
has evolved.</p>

<p><a name="stack"></a></p>

<h1 id="stack">Stack</h1>

<p>The technology stack’s not too complicated. I store data in MongoDB, and use
Flask to perform my Machine Learning. Then Flask interacts with a Javascript
front end to serve the D3 visualizations. Here’s a rough diagram:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User &lt;----&gt; D3, Javascript, HTML
            Flask
            Python
            PyMongo
Raw Data -&gt; MongoDB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a name="eda"></a></p>

<h1 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

<p>With access to our raw data in place, I can query the database for a specific
answer and see find all the clues used to describe the answer over time.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a snippet of the answer ELMO:</p>

<table>

<p><strong>Date</strong> is informative and <strong>Day of Week</strong> indicate
the difficulty of the puzzle. In the New York Times, Monday (1) is easiest and
gets progressively harder throughout the week, with Saturday being the toughest.
Sunday is usually a bigger puzzle at about a Wednesday-Thursday difficulty.</p>

<p>There’s a good amount of variations in clues here, but they mostly refer to the
furry red muppet on Sesame Street. In the 80s (not shown), ELMO is mostly used to describe
St. Elmo, the patron’s saint for sailors or the pollster Elmo Roper. Indeed, Roper only appeared
once since the 90s. We immediately see the difference of how Elmo is used.</p>

and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_of_Formia">Patron Saint of Sailors and Abdominal Pain</a></em></p>

<p>Euro used to be described as a large red kangaroo? Boy are times different.
And we’ll see the rise and fall of meanings later with some cool visulizations.</p>

<h1 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h1>

<p>So far I’ve injected my own insight to pick out the clusters of clues used. But
let’s have machine learning take care of that.</p>

<p>The first thing I do is query my database for a given word to collect all the
clues used. Then take all the clues and perform bag-of-words to get vectors of each
tokenized clues. Scikit-Learn’s CountVectorizer is perfect for this. The result
is a sparse matrix that looks something like this for the word CLAY</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Clue</th>
      <th>Ali</th>
      <th>once</th>

<p>We can see that the Great Compromiser and The Great Pacificator similarly
refers to early American politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay">Henry Clay</a> because they share the word
“Great”, and with k-means clustering by comparing their Euclidean distances,
the algorithm can do a good job picking similar topics out.</p>

<p>Here’s a snippet of CLAY when trying 5 clusters:</p>

<p>Group 1 and 2 makes sense, but in group 3 how did <em>Famous Whig</em> get related to
potter’s clay? So now I consider some concerns when it comes to crossword puzzles.</p>

<p><a name="challenges"></a></p>

<h1 id="considerations-and-challenges">Considerations and Challenges</h1>

<p>Crosswords are puzzles and clues are cleverly designed to be tricky - and
therefore fun when you can figure it out. But this is a challenge for my bag-of-words
model. Certain clues are phrased in such a way that there’s no immediate
connection to the answer. For example, here a few of my favorite ones from this
year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Drooling from both sides of the mouth</em>: DOUBLEDRIBBLE</li>
  <li><em>Fly swatter?</em>: BUZZERBEATER</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s only when you realize that there’s a basketball theme in the puzzle that
these answers start to make sense. How can I incorporate these nuances in my model?</p>

<p>In addition, clues are sparse, a few words at most. This reduces the number of
features available to me to measure similarity.</p>

<p>But there are certain rules that I can use to my advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Puzzles are symmetrical (rotational and at times horizontal)</li>
  <li>Answers are longer than 3 letters</li>
  <li>Tenses and plurality match</li>
  <li>Abbreviations are indicated with periods or <em>abbrv.</em></li>
  <li>Foreign words are also hinted as such</li>
  <li>Punctuations have meanings
    <ul>
      <li>? Question marks mean wordplay</li>
      <li>! Exclamation marks indicate it’s a phrase or exclamation</li>
      <li>” “ Quotes are also for sayings, or the title of book, movie, or work</li>
      <li>___ Blanks indicates a fill-in-the-blank clue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, answers come from common sources: geographical names like mountain
ranges, rivers, and cities can be found in an atlas. References to movies, actors/actresses,
books, or artists are usually popular enough.</p>

<p>I can’t address all of these challenges, but by creating my own <strong>tokenizer</strong>, I can
stem words so that I capture all the different tenses and plurality. And by
keeping capitalized words, I have a rough Named Entity Recognition system to
relate similar proper nouns. I also keep track of any punctuation that shows up
so that I can try to cluster similar clues like if wordplay or abbreviations are
present.</p>

<p>OK, now that I have beefed up my features, I can run my model and easily go from
my Python dictionary output to a JSON so that Javascript and D3 can read it. I
leverage NVD3 here for some great looking out-of-the-box charts.</p>

<p>The charts show how the answer was used in the past 40 years by graphing the
number of occurrences of the clue cluster per year. Here are some notable
illustrations:</p>

<p><a name="uber"></a></p>

<h3 id="uber">UBER</h3>

<div id="uber" class="chart">

</div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/xw/crossword.js"></script>

<p>As Professor Kruzman had shown in his NYT op-ed, UBER has gone through some
changes. In the past 40 years, my algorithm gathered that there are 4 distinct clusters
of clues used to describe UBER. In the light blue, we see it is consistently
used as a German word such as <strong>Over, in Berlin</strong>. In the dark orange, as a fill
in the blank in the German national anthem: <strong>“Deutschland ___ alles”</strong>. Then in
late 90s, as a <strong>Modern prefix meaning “super”</strong>. In the past few years, and coinciding
with the decline of UBER as a German word, it’s the <strong>Modern alternative to a taxi</strong>
as we know it today.</p>

<p><a name="euro"></a></p>

<h3 id="euro">EURO</h3>

<div id="euro" class="chart">
  <svg></svg>
</div>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, EURO has an interesting history too. While it’s
consistently used as a <strong>prefix for European</strong> things like eurodollar or
eurobonds, before the mid 90s, EURO was sometimes used as a tough clue for a
<strong>Large kangaroo</strong>. That use disappeared as the Euro currency started gaining
traction in the nineties. Its use as a <strong>new currency</strong> peaked at 1999 with the
official adoption of the currency. But then it lost its newness to gradually became
a <strong>replacement currency</strong>. Perhaps a reminiscence of the franc or Mark.</p>

<p><a name="net"></a></p>

<h3 id="net">NET</h3>

<div id="net" class="chart">
  <svg></svg>
</div>

<p>NET continues to be used as a term in <strong>sports</strong> such as fishing, volleyball, or
tennis, and to a small degree as a bottom line modifier such as net <strong>take-home pay</strong>.
But we can also trace the rise and importance of the <strong>internet</strong> in the 90s
just from crossword puzzles.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-good-k">What’s a good k?</h2>

<p>K is the number of clusters in my k-means algorithms that I want to try to find.
So far I’ve found k between 3-5 yields the best result, and I haven’t found any
answers that have more than 6 different meanings over time. But as a next step,
as I mention below, I want to make it dynamic for anyone to try to see what
clusters come up if you can vary k.</p>

<p><a name="nextsteps"></a></p>

<h1 id="extensions-and-next-steps">Extensions and Next Steps</h1>

<p>I only had 2 weeks to work on this project, so there are a lot of different things
I want to eventually try.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First of all, I want to go beyond k-means to perform my clustering. Even
though I don’t have a lot of features, I think a Word2Vec model with neural
network could yield better results. Or LDA or the new HDA.</li>
  <li>Next, make a fully functional web-app that many people can try by entering
their own word and see how its usage in crossword puzzles differed over time.
This should allow for a chosen k number of clusters and generate a graph in
a reasonable amount of time.</li>
  <li>Finally, attempt to build off of this exploratory project and generate a
themed crossword puzzle? I try to do this in my final project at Metis.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="last-word">Last Word</h1>

<p>This has been a very fun project for me, but look out as I host this project on
the web for you to try out. Also, I will be putting my code on Github shortly.
Let me know if you have questions or suggestions!</p>
