      <p>Just wrapped up Week 4 at Metis and that means we’re 1/3 of the way through
already. This week’s been very fun and challenging as we’re finally diving
into supervised learning. It’s also more relaxing being the first week of
our 3rd project. Here’s what we’ve been doing.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="material">Material:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Supervised Machine Learning
    <ul>
      <li>K Nearest Neighbor</li>
      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
      <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
      <li>Decision Trees, Ensemble, Bagging, and Bootstrap methods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SQL and NoSQL</li>
  <li>Setting up an EC2 server on free tier AWS to host a SQL server in the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>I am very impressed with how Metis is covering these machine learning algorithms.
Not only do the instructors present the basic idea and application, they attempt
to explain the math behind them. This is hard to do in a full week in a college
or graduate course, but they are doing a pretty awesome job.</p>

<p>I’m still learning about them too. And one of the best way I learn is to try to
teach them. So I’ll be writing a few tutorials to try to explain what’s going on.
Keep your eyes open for upcoming blogs on linear regression and logistic regression.</p>

<h2 id="project-3---supervised-learning-and-classification">Project 3 - Supervised Learning and Classification</h2>

<p>We started on our 3rd project this week. This time we’re using supervised
machine learning, specifically classification, to explore a dataset of our
choice.</p>

<p>A recommended starting point was the excellent
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>
for some prepared data set. There are some very interesting classification
problems here. I was initially very interested in the
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS" target="_blank">Higgs Boson</a> data, but thought
that while I might be able to make a good classification model, I lack the
domain expertise to interpret my findings well enough in just 3 weeks.</p>

<p>I also wanted to explore New York City’s education using the vast amount of
data available on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data" target="_blank">NYC Open Data</a>
but before I was able to come up with an interesting and compelling question, I
came across a cool and current <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management" target="_blank">challenge on Kaggle</a>
doing classification to expedite credit card applications for BNP Paribas. So
I’ll be working on this for Project 3 and through the duration of the Kaggle
competition.</p>

<h2 id="guest-speaker-david-robinson">Guest Speaker: David Robinson</h2>

<p>David Robinson of Stack Overflow came to speak to us on Thursday about some of
his current project and gave some great advice. I blog about
his visit <a href="/2016/02/04/david-robinson-speaks-to-metis/">here</a>.</p>

<p>His excellent blog on statistics, R and data science is

<h2 id="other-events-this-week">Other Events This Week:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LinkedIn Workshop</strong>: One of our career advisor, Jennifer, led us on a
workshop to improve our LinkedIn profile. It’s great to see the hands on
emphasis that Metis is placing on having a professional profile that showcase
our skills and data science experience.
Here’s my <a href="" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>. Feel free to
connect with me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2 on 1 meeting with Jason and Debbie</strong>: I had a chance to sit down with
Jason, Metis co-founder, and <a href="http://www.thesciencebabe.com/" target="_blank">Debbie</a>,
Metis chief data scientist, to talk about my experiences and feedback so far
at Metis. I am having a very rewarding and fun time. I expressed that having
real projects to work on at Metis was and continues to be a huge draw for me.
I also suggested 2 things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear algebra</strong> is quite important to be able to understand how
most machine learning algorithms work behind the scenes. I recommended that
some linear algebra be included in the pre-work for new students.</li>
      <li><strong>Business application</strong> when it comes to data science projects. You hear
everyone talking about how cool and sexy data science is. While every company
is rushing into this field, at the end of the day this is still a cost center
to a business. Whether or not students want to be working at a for-profit
organization, I think there needs to be some discussion on how to present and
formulate a business case around our projects.
I think a great way without adding more lecture material is to bring in a
speaker that can speak from a business or product management perspective on
a data science team.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google foobar programming challenge</strong>: I had the bandwidth this week to work
on the next programming challenge. This one took me the longest to do
brainstorm and implement so far. But I was able to complete level 3 this week!
I talk about my experiences so far <a href="/2016/02/05/foobar-part-2/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NYC Data Science Study Group Meetup</strong>: I went to a
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group/events/226130151/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>
on Monday at Dstillery with Susan Sun presenting on <a href="https://github.com/sunwsusan/Meetup_NYCDataScienceStudyGroup/tree/master/2016_02" target="_blank">Feature Engineering</a>.
Great talk and I met some people from General Assembly’s part time data science
programing during the networking time. Lots of fun and I’ll be going to more
Meetups.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
