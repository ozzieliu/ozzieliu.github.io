      <p>Week 3 of Metis Datascience Bootcamp just wrapped up today with project presentations
of our 2nd project. My project on movie data
will be featured in next post, but here’s what else we’ve done in the past 2 weeks,
including linear regression, web scraping, and statistics…
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="supervised-learning">Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>Week 2 was kicked off with an immediate deep dive with supervised learning; the
modeling of a data set based on defined targets. With a well trained model, we
can apply that to predict and test additional inputs to determine a possible
result.</p>

<p>The first topic was regression:</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression">Linear Regression</h3>
<p>I have some experience with linear regression, and its concepts are easy enough
to visualize with 1 or 2 features. But I really appreciated that the class
emphasized on all the assumptions and shortcomings when applying linear
regression - such as bias vs. variance, overfitting, the curse of dimensionality,
and the concern of heteroscedastic random variables in our data.</p>

<p>As with any machine learning algorithm, the importance of splitting our data
into training and test sets is critical. We looked at <strong>cross-validation</strong> with
Leave-one-out (LOOCV), k-fold, and random sampling as possible types to improve
the testing of our linear regression model.</p>

<p>To find the best features for our linear regression model, we learn several
regularization method such as <strong>lasso</strong> and <strong>ridge regression</strong>.</p>

<p>What I’ve seen from learning to apply linear regression with Python is the lack
of documentation and examples that fully explain how. So I plan on writing a few
articles demonstrating examples of applying linear regression with the
Python Statsmodels package.</p>

<h2 id="statistics-and-probability">Statistics and Probability</h2>
<p>We also began studying statistics and probability. Starting with a review
of basic probability and continuous probability, we moved from frequentist to
the interesting realm of Bayesian statistics with conditional probability and
Bayes Theorem.</p>

<p>On the statistics side, we explored <strong>null hypothesis testing</strong> to determine if an
outcome is indeed significant or if it could have likely happened by random
chance. Now armed with the tools to measure our data science models’ significance
we can immediately apply that to our project.</p>

<h2 id="project-2---linear-regression">Project 2 - Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Codenamed “Project Luther”, after the dedicated TV detective,
we scraped and analyzed movie data to answer an interesting question.
Instead of providing everyone with a clean set of data to work with, we were tasked with
formulating our own hypothesis and then individually collecting the data that we
need for our analysis.</p>

<p>This was really cool as it lets us experience what data scientists have to do to
<strong>collect, wrangle, and clean data</strong> before it can be used effectively to create our
models.</p>

<p>Here’s a write up of my project: <a href="/2016/01/31/roger-ebertron/">The Roger-Ebertron</a>.</p>

<h2 id="web-scraping-with-beautiful-soup-and-selenium">Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium</h2>
<p>Fortunately Metis do show us how we can gather data by scraping the web. We
looked at Python tools such as <strong>Beautiful Soup</strong> to parse HTML and <strong>Selenium</strong> for web
automation to make our lives much easier with a crash course in HTML and CSS and
live demonstration of these tools.</p>

<p>By the end of these 2 weeks, my web scraping skills have jumped leaps and bounds.
But it is also extremely helpful when web designers label their HTML and CSS
elements well.</p>

<p>However, I did find the learning curve of BeautifulSoup pretty steep, with no
easy tutorial online. So I’ll try to provide some concrete examples on my blog.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</h2>
<p>Web scraping for their project did take most students a while. And after a session
on creating a Minimum Viable Product, we were tasked on the same day to create a
presentation for our project based on what we have gathered so far. That was a
challenging but ultimately beneficial endeavor to help me organize what I have so
far and if my question is actually interesting and presentable.</p>

<p>Here’s a post on my MVP.</p>

<h2 id="cool-stuff">Cool Stuff:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Guest speaker Liv Buli</strong> of Next Big Sound came to speak to us on Thursday
1/28 on <em>“Story Telling + Data Science + Data Visualization = Data Journalism”</em>.
It was extremely insightful and I discuss her talk and my thoughts on this
<a href="/2016/01/28/liv-buli-next-big-sound-talks/">post</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Metis Open House</strong> was this Tuesday night, and I had a chance to meet some
Metis alumni to see what they’re doing now, and to share my experiences so far
with prospective students.</li>
  <li><strong>Stats Worksheet</strong>: Our TA <a href="http://reshama.nyc/" target="_blank">Reshma</a> gave us some excellent resources in
statistics and linear regression, including a worksheet where we have get to
walk through a simple regression problem with pencil and a calculator to see
each step of the process. We had to manually compute the regression beta
values, find the residuals, calculate our R-squared values, and then test our
model for significance. It was extremely helpful to understand regression.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concerns">Concerns:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Just one area that I recommended to the Metis leaders: there’s no expectation
of <strong>linear algebra</strong> for the course. And some students have not seen the
summation <script type="math/tex">\Sigma</script> symbol before. When I started learning data science on my own, I find linear
algebra to be indispensable in understanding what happens behind some machine l
earning models. I’d recommend that a crash course in at least linear algebra
notation to be included. And even in the pre-work before new students start
the bootcamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I try to share my work on my <a href="https://github.com/ozzieliu/metis-datascience" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.
You can find my <strong>pair programming work, investigation, and projects</strong>
(when they’re made presentation ready).</p>

<p>Take a look, and as always, let me know what you think!</p>
